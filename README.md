- Percentage of high earners (>50K) with and without advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate)  
- Minimum number of work hours per week and percentage of high earners among them

The project was built as part of the **[freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer)** curriculum.
